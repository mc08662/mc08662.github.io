I am a Mechanical Engineer specialised in Computational Fluid Dynamics, holding a PhD from the School of Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering of CITY, University of London.

***

I am primarily interested in numerical methods, applied research and complex engineering problems.
My PhD focused on numerical modelling of multiphase flows with direct industrial and biological applications.

I am genuinely intrigued by the physics and mathematics of system dynamics, whether their applications refer to structural, fluid, coupled systems or other systems.
Although my research is related to fluid dynamics and relevant computational methods, throughout my studies I had the opportunity to get familiar with applications of aero-elasticity and fluid-structure interaction, system control and bio-engineering signal modelling, and thus, to develop a more abstract and holistic view on the subject.


Moreover, my attraction to numerical methods led me to develop robust programming skills and work on different scientific programming languages.
I am also an open-source software enthusiast.
