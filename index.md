I am a Mechanical Engineer specialised in Computational Fluid Dynamics.
I recently received my PhD from the School of Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering of [CITY, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/).

## Academic Background
### Research
The subject of my PhD was cavitating flows with potential bio-engineering applications.

Cavitation is the phenomenon of vaporization of liquids, not through heating (boiling), but through acceleration. A ship propeller can accelerate the ambient water so abruptly and severely that the static pressure falls bellow the saturation value and the water turns into vapour. The induced vapour cavities turn back to liquid water after a short period, often following an implosion, which could damage mechanical structure and equipment.

The work was motivated by the potential of cavitation induction in blood flow through a prosthetic mechanical heart valve, reported by some experiments in the past.

From the fall of 2015 until the end of 2019, I was working in _CITY_, as part of an european research program, _CaFE_, focusing on cavitation erosion. In order to study the mechanical heart valve flow, I was developing a CFD tool to accommodate the body motion of the valve leaflets in the computational fluid domain.

The tool follows the immersed boundary method, is generic and can be used in various applications, compressible or incompressible, turbulent or laminar, multi- or single-phase flows. This approach is ideal for modelling solids of complicated geometry or undergoing large displacement or deformation, avoiding the cumbersome mesh generation.

### Education

I studied Mechanical Engineering in National Technical University of Athens ([NTUA](https://www.ntua.gr)).

In _NTUA_, I received a wide range of courses, following the default academic program, covering many fields of Mechanical Engineering, from fluid and structural dynamics to fundamentals of electronic circuits, control systems, energy engineering and bio-engineering. I then opted for the Air and Ground Transport Vehicles specialisation, where I focused on aerodynamics, flight dynamics and aerodynamic optimization.
My diploma thesis was a study of a truss structure for a deformable wind turbine blade, where the possibility of replacing the conventional beam structure of the blade by a truss with few actuators, that could deform the blade according to a control system.

## Professional Career
### Work Experience

From October 2015 to October 2018, I was employed by CITY, University of London, as a Research Fellow in framework of [CaFE ITN project](http://cafe-project.eu/). _CaFE_ was an interdisciplinary project that investigated cavitation erosion. The work done then was part of my PhD and regarded mainly code development on [OpenFOAM](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-2.4.x).

During my studies, I completed an internship at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr) - The French Aerospace Laboratory, at the Applied Aerodynamics Department. There I worked on the development of a hybridization tool, which would merge numerical and experimental data, to benefit from the detail of numerical computations and the precision of aerodynamic experiments and provide more accurate pressure field information. The internship in _ONERA_ lasted from October 2013 to February 2014.

### Interests and Skills

My main scientific interest is dynamics, from both a mathematical and physical point of view, which however refer to wide variety of disciplines and applications, such as fluid dynamics, system dynamics and control theory.
Although my doctorate's research was focused on fluid dynamics and relevant computational methods, throughout my studies I had the opportunity to get familiar with applications of aero-elasticity and fluid-structure interaction, optimization, system control and bio-engineering signal modelling.

Attracted by numerical modelling and analysis, I have developed programming skills and worked with various engineering-oriented software packages.
